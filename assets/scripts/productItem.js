//Create a class called `ProductItem` that will have the following properties:

const productItem = {
  product: {}, // instance of Product class
  addToCart() {
    // just console.log the product for now
  },
  render() {
    // return the product element with the product data (<li>)
  },
};


/* Test your class by creating a new instance of it with
 hardcoded values and calling the `render` method. Also, test the `addToCart` 
 method by clicking on the button and check if shows the product in the console.
